### 1 Section 6 Introduction

Mikey and Ben Introduce the Fluffy Bunny Section.

### 2 Section 6 Assets



### 5 Planning Our Scene

+ Get familiar with rabbits!
+ Look at the desired outcome and plan our modelling journey towards that goal.

**Section Brief**

+ Rabbit is sat in grass and is still.
+ It is a summers day with a light breeze.
+ There should be additional foliage around the rabbit.
+ The Rabbit does not have to be realistic.

### 6 Knowing Your Subject

+ Re-enforce the importance of reference material.
+ See what happens when you just plough forward with out consulting your reference material, like I started to do!

### 7 Layers

+ Know how to turn layers on and off.
+ Turn on the layer management tool.
+ Understand layers are useful for working on separate parts of a scene or even model.
+ Realise if a layer is OFF the final render will not contain anything that was on that layer.

### 8 Meta Balls

+ Learn how to add a meta ball.
+ Use them to quickly build up a base framework.
+ See they’re great for modelling organic objects.
+ Understand they need converting afterwards to a mesh so we can add further detail.

### 9 Basics Sculpting

+ Learn the basics of sculpting.
+ Adjust your brush’s type, strength and size.
+ Understand how ‘Dyntopo’ works and when to use it.
+ How to find a brush if you have deleted it!

### 10 Basic Sculpting Solution Video

+ See my solution to the ‘Define Your Bunny’s Shape’ Challenge

### 10a GPU Rendering In This Section ###

+ Understand that even with a dedicated GPU you may end up with out of memory issue if your card doesn’t have enough RAM.
+ Some AMD cards may not render hairs correctly.

### 10b Applying Transforms With Particle Systems
+ Refresher on applying transforms
+ Show you why you need to do it.

###10c Alternative Ear Construction
+ This may help with your particle system and hair placement
+ Always more than one way, to do something in Blender
+ Thanks to Alberto for experimenting and contributing to the community

### 11 Your First Particle System

+ Create a particle system.
+ Understand children and how they relate to their parents.
+ Hopefully avoid crashing your computer! (or waiting a VERY long time)

### 12 Fake Users

+ Learn how to give your hair/fur colour!
+ Understand about Fake Users and how to use them.
+ Realise what the 0 before anything in Blender means.

### 13 Particle Editing

+ Be introduced to the Particle Edit option.
+ Learn how to edit the particles
+ Style the hairs to make them flow in a more natural manner.
+ Learn how to reset the hairs back to default state.

### 14 Weight Painting

+ Use weight painting and vertex groups to control where the particle system actually appears, and where it does not.

### 15 Adding Randomness with Children

+ Adjust the particle’s settings to get a more realistic and less uniform hair appearance.

### 16 Multiple Cameras

+ Add another camera to the Scene
+ Change the primary camera
+ Learn how to quickly move the camera around.
+ Change the Camera Properties.

### 17 Exporting and Particle Systems

+ See how particle systems export from Blender.
+ Learn how to convert them.
+ Understand that this can break your modelling flow.
+ Realise you may be better off using the particle system in the other program you are exporting too.

### 18 Hiding Objects

+ Learn more about Hiding objects in Blender.
+ See how to Hide everything except the object you are working on.

### 19 Introduction To The Image Editor

+ Make the Iris for our Bunny.
+ Learn how to Export an image with transparency.
+ Only Use Blender - so there will be some limitations.
+ Understand there are better programs for image creation and editing (Photoshop, Gimp etc.)

### 20 Combining Shaders In Cycles

### 21 UV Unwrapping and Texture Mapping

+ Understand an image texture replaces the colour of a material.
+ Learn how to Unwrap part of a mesh and apply the texture to it.

### 22 Adding a Sky Box

+ Add a skybox to our scene.
+ Use that skybox as the primary light source for the whole scene.

### 23 Using Textures Vs. Geometry

+ Understand you need both - the texture has to exist on something!
+ See that Geometry is for detail and textures are for the illusion of detail.
+ Realise that the appropriate combination of both is used to create models

### 23b Understanding Textures & Nodes

### 24 Importing Images As Planes

+ Setup the Add-on that enables you to import images as planes.
+ Be able to import an image into a scene.
+ Realise this can be another way of importing reference material.

### 25 Packing External Data

+ Learn how to embed images into the blend file, both individually and collectively.
+ Understand this is essential when sharing a file with someone else.
+ Can create bloat if the external data becomes obsolete.
+ Show you how to remove external data

### 26 Node Type Overview

+ Look at the Nodes that are created for the textures.
+ Learn about the different types of connection points and what the coloured dots are.
+ Which ones can be connected together and what they would do.

### 27 Textures With Transparency

+ Learn how to use cycle’s nodes to apply transparency to your image.
+ Use groups for nodes for simplicity
+ Use those node groups again on other materials.

### 28 Textures Without Transparency

+ Import an image without a transparent layer - no Alpha Channel.
+ Understand that this is useful if you have no image editing software, no time to process a load of images, or just trying out images for your textures

**What is Alpha?**

+ If an image contains an alpha channel, each image pixel is represented has an value which specifies the opacity of that pixel. In alpha channels, 100% is opaque pixel and 0% is transparent pixel.

**Not the best way…**
+ Ideal to have a Solid coloured background, either 100% Black or 100% White to separate the image from the background.
+ It would be best if your images are processed to include an alpha (transparency) channel RGBA.

### 29 Testing The Grass

+ Name your new texture layer.
+ Turn back on the camera and lighting and the grass layer.

### 30 Light Path Render Settings

+ Learn about light paths and how there are critical when using transparency.

### 31 Making Textures Look More 3D

+ Play with the texture planes to alter their appearance.
+ Understand, the more complexity you add here the less you may need later on.

### 32 Using Objects With Particle Systems

+ Learn how you can place hundreds of objects easily and fluidly using the particle system.
+ Control the distribution of particles using Weight Painting and Vertex Groups
+ Turn off outlines when they clutter the view.

### 33 Layering Particles Systems in Blender

+ See the Solution to the last lecture.
+ Use a series of particle systems to plant our various grass types.
+ Use low values during prototyping to get a feel of how the grass will look.

### 34 Introduction to Sapling

+ Turn on the sapling add-on.
+ Learn the fundamentals of sapling.
+ Understand to save before using sapling.
+ Learn how to prevent blender ‘crashing’ when using sapling.

### 35 Using Sapling To Make A Basic Tree

+ Look at the tree presets.
+ See how to add leaves to your tree in sapling.
+ Learn where leaves are placed on the tree.
+ How to get it looking more like a tree at the base.

### 36 Depth Of Field Using Cycles
+ Let's make this scene even better
+ Add in a Camera effect called depth of field
