# New Version Of Blender
* Update your version of Blender.
* Look at the settings changes I will be using.
* Enable your first couple of add-ons!

# Planning Our Project
* Get familiar with rabbits!
* Look at the desired outcome and plan our modelling journey towards that goal.

# Planning Our Project
* Rabbit is sat in grass and is still.
* It is a summers day with a light breeze.
* There should be additional foliage around the rabbit.
* The Rabbit does not have to be realistic.

# Knowing Your Subject
* Re-enforce the importance of reference material.
*See what happens when you just plough forward with out consulting your reference material, like I started to do!

# Layers
* Know how to turn layers on and off.
* Turn on the layer management tool.
* Understand layers are useful for working on separate parts of a scene or even model.
* Realise if a layer is OFF the final render will not contain anything that was on that layer.

# Meta Balls
* Learn how to add a meta ball.
* Use them to quickly build up a base framework.
* See theyâ€™re great for modelling organic objects.
* Understand they need converting afterwards to a mesh so we can add further detail.
